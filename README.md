# Low-Level Design (LLD) Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my structured and hands-on practice of **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Design Patterns**.  
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in designing scalable, maintainable, and extensible software systems, following industry-standard best practices.

The repository is designed to evolve continuously as more LLD problems, patterns, and real-world design exercises are added.

## Covered Topics

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Real-world object modeling

### 2. SOLID Principles
- SRP – Single Responsibility Principle  
- OCP – Open/Closed Principle  
- LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle  
- ISP – Interface Segregation Principle  
- DIP – Dependency Inversion Principle  

Each principle includes:
- Concept explanation
- Code-level examples
- Design trade-offs

### 3. Design Patterns
Implemented with a focus on **why**, **when**, and **how** to use them.

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Decorator Pattern

Each pattern contains:
- Problem statement
- UML-level thinking (conceptual)
- Clean, modular implementation
- Use cases and limitations

### 4. LLD Case Study
**First_LLD_Design_Document_editor**
- A complete low-level design exercise
- Focus on class design, responsibilities, and extensibility
- Demonstrates practical application of OOPS + SOLID + Design Patterns

---

## Design Philosophy

- Clean code over clever code
- Separation of concerns
- Extensibility and maintainability
- Industry-aligned LLD thinking
- Interview-ready explanations

---

## Tech Stack
- Language: C++ / Java / Python (pattern-dependent)
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Design
- Focus: Low-Level Architecture & Design Patterns

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Navigate topic-wise (OOPS → SOLID → Design Patterns)
- Study individual pattern folders independently
- Use code as reference for:
  - Interviews
  - System design preparation
  - Real-world software design

---

## Future Additions

- More design patterns (Adapter, Command, State, Proxy, Builder, etc.)
- LLD problems (Parking Lot, Elevator, Cache, Logger, BookMyShow, etc.)
- UML diagrams
- Design trade-off documentation
- Refactoring exercises
